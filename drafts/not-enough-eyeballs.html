<p>In 2016 I excitedly joined a small Bitcoin exchange to flex my nacent
cryptocurrency knowledge and hopefully learn some more. One of the other
employees, let’s call him Harry, was really keen to tell me more about
Ethereum, and this magical new “smart contract” called The DAO.</p>
<p>Even then I had enough background in Computer Science that when he
dropped the term <em>turing-complete</em> I gave a moment’s pause.</p>
<p>I remember thinking that sounded pretty dangerous. A little known
fact, even among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, is that every Bitcoin
transaction actually contains a small program written in a language
called Bitcoin Script. It’s use cases are limited to verifying
signatures (including transactions with signatures from multiple
parties) and time locking funds. Bitcoin Script is hobbled in a very
important way. In fact, it was designed that way on purpose.</p>
<p>That sounds pretty counter-intuitive, but there’s a good reason for
it. Bitcoin Script is a non-turing-complete language. There are
advantages that come with this. Programs written in such a language are
<em>way</em> easier to prove correct, since by definition they can’t
compute all computable things. Since, in some sense, proving things
correct involves making some mathematical argument about a collosal
number of mathematical entities, the fact that the language can’t
express as much has the benefit of making things <em>way easier</em> to
prove. In this sense a non-turing-complete language’s limited
expressiveness is its strength.</p>
<p>Ethereum was explicitly designed <em>around</em> a turing-complete
smart contract language. Simple, non-expressive languages are great for
correctness, but you can’t build a thriving ecosystem of interesting
financial instruments, games, governance strutures (and so on) without a
fully expressive programming language. Ethereum was meant to push the
boundaries of what a cryptocurrency could be. It delivered on this
promise almost immediately. Wheras Bitcoin was really limited to only
multi-sig transactions and timelocks with Bitcoin Script, Ethereum
bloomed with smart contracts defining new tokens (which developed their
own independent value) and decentralised organisation contracts that
provided a means by which projects could be proposed, voted on, and
funded.</p>
<p>These advantages came with an obvious, and weighty, downside – one
that I could only see that early on because of my luck in attending a
university that taught <em>formal verification</em> and an unorthodox
career choice to work on formally verifying an operating system
micro-kernel. Although I knew next to nothing about <a
href="https://docs.soliditylang.org">Solidity</a>, my background told me
that I should be worried. Solidity would allow any user, of any skill
level, to write programs that might conceivably end up containing
hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars of value inside them.
And yet, it was Ethereum’s stated goal that these funds would not be
controlled by the whims of human beings, only code.</p>
<p>Because of this, it’s of paramount importance that they be correct.
Given the sheer amount of wealth, even at 2016 exchange rates, sloshing
around in the Ethereum blockchain it was conceivable that some of these
smart contracts might end up with hundreds of thousands or even millions
of dollars of value inside them and yet be vulnerable to simplest of</p>
<p>What I didn’t expect was the rapidity with which this happened. When
Harry told me that The DAO had over $60M of ETH in it, I was loathe to
believe it. *I tried to tell Harry that I thought there was a good
chance it could get hacked but, at the time, I don’t think he’d even
heard the term turing-complete and telling him “that sounds dangerous”
was much like telling a toddler that trucks – the same things that make
him squeal with delight as they rumble on by – can maim and kill.</p>
<p>Two weeks later <a
href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-was-the-dao-hack/">the DAO
hack</a> occurred, sent the entire Ethereum community into chaos, and
led to serious debates about whether “code is law” could be taken
seriously, and eventually resulted in a hard fork that split Ethereum
forever in twain, into Ethereum and <a
href="https://ethereumclassic.org/">Ethereum Classic</a>.</p>
<p>I walked into work the day after it happened feeling like
Nostradamus. The other employees seemed to think that I was in posession
of some kind of secret knowledge but the story was far more prosaic than
that. A few</p>
